#### Pub version 0.13.0
  * Up to date with [TemplateBinding#41e95ea][41e95ea] (release 0.4.0)
  * Using this package now requires some additional javascript polyfills, that
    were moved out of platform.js. These files are listed under lib/js, and all
    are required in addition to platform.js from the web_components package.

  * Up to date with [TemplateBinding#6a2808c][6a2808c] (release 0.3.5)

#### Pub version 0.12.0+4
  * Widen the dependency constraint on `observe`.

#### Pub version 0.12.0+3
  * fix bug in interop layer to ensure callbacks are run in the dirty-checking
    zone (this only affected running code directly in Dartium without running
    pub-build or pub-serve)

#### Pub version 0.12.0
  * NodeBind interop support. This allows elements such as Polymer's
    core-elements and paper-elements to work properly with Dart binding paths,
    including using Elements and functions as values, and two-way bindings.
  * NodeBind is no longer ported. It now comes from
    packages/web_components/platform.js

    PropertyPath if there is a non-null delegateFn).
  * Ported up to commit [TemplateBinding#99e52d][99e52d] and
    [NodeBind#f7cc76][f7cc76].
